# The first line has to start with '# tractometry_path=' and specify the path to the Tractometry files.
# "SUBJECT_ID" will get replaced by each ID from the list below
#
# The second line can start with '# bundles=' and then a subset of bundles can be specified which shall be
# analyzed. If the second line is left empty all bundles will be analyzed.
#
# The third line can start with '# plot_3D=' and has to be specified if the option '--plot3D' is set when calling
# 'plot_tractometry_results'. This option will generated 3D plots of the streamlines of each bundle. The coloring
# indicates the average FA (or any other metric used for Tractometry) for each segment (100 segments per default)
# across all subjects. '# plot_3D=' has to  specify the path to the tractseg_output folder of one subject which
# will be plotted.
#
# Apart from the first three lines all other lines which start with `#` will be ignored.
# This file will get parsed as a space separated csv file.
#
# The first column has to be 'subject_id' and is mandatory.
# The second column has to be 'group' (for a group comparison; containing only 0 or 1) or 'target' (for a correlation
# analysis; containing the value you want to calculate the correlation for).
# Any additional column will be treated as a confound and regressed out of the data before doing the statistical
# analysis.
#
# Note: Make sure there is no trailing whitespace at any line
